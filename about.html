At present, I am learning web development with one of the best teacher Angela Yu. It's fun and
enjoying, never thought programming would be this fun and interesting.</p>

<p>I pass out my class 10 in Douglas Memorial High School. Which I would describe as one of the best
moment in my life and have a remarkable impact on me. I did my class 11 and 12 in Sielmat Christian
Higher Secondary School.This is the most crucial stage in my life.Here, I decided what I want to 
become in life and found my purpose. I even met a girl, which I would describe as the best thing that 
ever happen to me.She inspires me,motivates me to keep moving in life.

<p>The two most important person in my life. I want to give massive thanks to my MOM and DAD.For being
the Angel in my life.Allowing me to do what I dream.Support me and shower me with love.They are the best
Parents and I could never wish for more.They did their best for me and sometimes more than what I can do.
Hey Mom and Dad I want you to know this thing that I feel safe when your are around. I might not be the 
one to say I love you everyday But I do . I really do.


<p>I thought my life was going smooth. But certain invetiable challenges comes in my life and for instant
I want  to give up. But everything that happens and what to happen in my life is for a reason.God knows the
best for me better than I do. I keep my life path and into thee your hand lead me. GOD BLESS THE BROKEN ROAD!!!</p>
